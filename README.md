# Simple-Assembly-Program

An Assembler with Debugging and Disassembling capabilities, written in Swift. 
Within this repo you can also find an program that is a turing machine written in assembly language, whose purpose was to test the assembler.
Perhaps it would be more apt to call this project a virtual assembler, since it deals with virtual memory of a virtual machine as opposed to dealing directly with the memory of the actual machine. This was the final project of my 11th grade programming class.
